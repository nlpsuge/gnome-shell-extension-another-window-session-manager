# gnome-shell-extension-another-window-session-manager
Close open windows gracefully and save them as a session. And you can restore them when necessary manually or automatically at startup.

Most importantly, it supports both X11 and Wayland!

This extension is based on several [Gnome technologies](https://www.gnome.org/technologies/) and APIs including [Meta](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/meta9~9_api), [Shell](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/shell01~0.1_api/) and [St(Shell Toolkit)](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/st10~1.0_api/).

## Close windows

### Auto close session
Enable this feature through `Auto close session` under `Close windows`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271720/214387813-fece3c78-6e27-494a-9edd-4705350c7179.png)

After you click the `Log Out/Restart/Power Off` button:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271720/214377307-0af5b841-93b8-4b6c-bd09-7a620dc79025.png)

If the second button on the above dialog has `via AWSM`, it means this feature is enabled. 

After you click `Log Out(via AWSM)`, all apps and windows will be closed automatically by AWSM. But some apps might be still opening, you have to close them yourself; then if there are no running apps, this extension logs out the current user immediately.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271720/214394659-651e6259-842c-49ca-9c97-6df62c9485d1.png)

You can move it around in case it covers other windows.

Please note that currently if this option is enabled, it modifies the Gnome Shell `endSessionDialog` **globally**, which means running `gnome-session-quit --logout` will also popup the new modified dialog.

### How to make `Close by rules` work

```bash
# 1. Install `ydotool` using the package manager and make sure the version is greater than v1.0.0
sudo dnf install ydotool
#Or install it from the source code: https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool 

#Check the permission of `/dev/uinput`, if it's `crw-rw----+`, you can skip step 2
# 2. Get permission to access to `/dev/uinput` as the normal user
sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/60-awsm-ydotool-uinput.rules
sudo echo '# See:
     # https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-devices/blob/master/60-steam-input.rules 
     # https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool/issues/25

     # ydotool udev write access
     KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", TAG+="uaccess", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/60-awsm-ydotool-uinput.rules
#Remove executable permission (a.k.a. x)
sudo chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/60-awsm-ydotool-uinput.rules

# 3. Copy ydotool.service to /usr/lib/systemd/user, so `systemctl --user enable ydotool.service` can work
sudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/ydotool.service /usr/lib/systemd/user
# 4. Autostart the ydotoold service under the normal user
systemctl --user enable ydotool.service


## misc. ##

# Check if the ydotoold service is running, if not it can be started by the folowing cmd
systemctl --user status ydotool.service
# Start the ydotoold service under the normal user
systemctl --user start ydotool.service

# Check if ydotool is working. the word `hello` should print on the terminal, if not you might need to reboot the system or try to relogin your account. 
ydotool type 'hello'
```

Feel free to fill an issue if `ydotool` does not work under normal user, you may also want to do that in [its git issue area](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool/issues)

## Restore sessions

### Restore previous apps and windows at startup
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271720/214390369-04736886-6dac-48de-bcde-782277a4448e.png)

Activate `Restore previous apps and windows at startup` to enable this feature. This option and `Restore selected session at startup` are exclusive. And this option works for shutting down the system normally (via Log Out/Restart/Power Off buttons) and other ways (like pressing the physical power-off button).

Then while startup, AWSM will launch and restore apps and states from the previous saved session configs.

The session configs are saved in the path `~/.config/another-window-session-manager/sessions/currentSession`.

You can use the below command to test it. 
```bash
gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.awsm --object-path /org/gnome/Shell/Extensions/awsm --method org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.awsm.Autostart.RestorePreviousSession "{'removeAfterRestore': <false>}"
```

### How to `Restore a session at startup`?

To make it work, you must enable it through `Restore sessions -> Restore at startup` in the Preferences AND active a session by clicking <img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271720/162792222-0fc7e6ca-1382-49cf-975a-f53d878d0479.png width="24" height="13"> in the popup menu.

While you enable it through `Restore sessions -> Restore at startup`, it creates a `_gnome-shell-extension-another-window-session-manager.desktop` under the folder `~/.config/autostart/`. 

Test the settings in command line via:
```Bash
gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.awsm --object-path /org/gnome/Shell/Extensions/awsm --method org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.awsm.Autostart.RestoreSession
```

Please do not modify `_gnome-shell-extension-another-window-session-manager.desktop`, all changes by yourself could be overidden or deleted.

# Dependencies
* procps-ng

Use `ps` and `pwdx` to get some information from a process, install it via `dnf install procps-ng` if you don't have.

* glib2

Use `gdbus` to call the remote method, which is provided by this exension, to implement the `restore at start` feature. `gdbus` is part of `glib2`.

* ydotool

Send keys to close the application gracefully with multiple windows.

# Known issues

1. On both X11 and Wayland, if click restore button (<img src=icons/restore-symbolic.svg width="14" height="14">) continually during the process of restoring, the window size and position may can't be restored, and it may restore many instances of an application. **As a workaround, click the restore button (<img src=icons/restore-symbolic.svg width="14" height="14">) only once until all apps are restored.**

# Support applications launched via a command line or applications that don't have a proper .desktop file
If the .desktop is missing from a session file, restoring an application relies on the command line completely.

In this case this extension will generate a .desktop in the `journalctl` when you click the save button (<img src=icons/save-symbolic.svg width="14" height="14">). Search `Generated a .desktop file` in `journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -r` to find it: `journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -b -o cat --no-pager | grep 'Generated a .desktop file'`. To make it work, You need to copy it to `~/.local/share/applications`, and relaunch the app and save the session again. This extension should be able to restore the workspace, state, size and position of this application.

**The generated .desktop might not work sometimes, it's better to check whether the value of `Exec` is correct or not.** If you restore an app using a bad .desktop, this extension will give you a notification and log error level logs in the `journalctl`.

I tested on Anki, VirtualBox machine and two .AppImage apps, they all have no .desktop and are launched in the terminal. By using the generated .desktop, Anki, VirtualBox machine works. One .AppImage app works. Another .AppImage app is `Wire_x86_64.AppImage` and doesn't work, because the command line returned is something like `/tmp/.mount_Wire-3xxxxx/wire-desktop`, you can use it to launch Wire but files in the `/tmp` will be deleted during the OS shutdown and start.

It's impossible / hard to query the command line from a process, the pid of a window might not be right too and I don't find a standard way for this.

## How can I know whether a .desktop of an application is proper or not?

One of the following should be enough to prove the .desktop is not proper:
1. Right click on the icon in the panel or dash, if there is no `Add to Favorites` in the menu
2. This extension can launch an application, but can't move the window to its workspace. (But it might suggest there is a bug in this extension, LOL :))

Most existing applications should have a proper .desktop. I'm just handling the special case. Someone like myself might want this feature.

# Where are the saved sessions?
They are all in `~/.config/another-window-session-manager/sessions`. When use an existing name to save the current open windows, the previous file will be copied to `~/.config/another-window-session-manager/sessions/backups` as a new name, which is the-old-session-name**.backup-current-timestamp**.

Note that I've marked `backups` as a reserved word, so you can't use it as a session name when saving a session. But you do have the freedom to manually create a file named `backups` in `~/.config/another-window-session-manager/sessions`. But this extension will only backup the session file that you are clicking the save button and you will receive an error log in the `journalctl` and an error notification every time you save an existing session.
